  "Write a method that handles Fibonacci sequences.
  Have it return the nth item in the Fibonacci sequence.
  Hint: The first item in the sequence is 0."

checks:
  ruby:
    asserts:
      - assert_equal 0, fibo_finder(0)
      - assert_equal 1, fibo_finder(1)
      - assert_equal 3, fibo_finder(4)
      - assert_equal 13, fibo_finder(7)
      - assert_equal 55, fibo_finder(10)

  javascript:
    asserts:
      - assert_equal(0, fiboFinder(0))
      - assert_equal(1, fiboFinder(1))
      - assert_equal(3, fiboFinder(4))
      - assert_equal(13, fiboFinder(7))
      - assert_equal(55, fiboFinder(10))
