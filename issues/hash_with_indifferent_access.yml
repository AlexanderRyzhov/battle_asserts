description:
  Implement a hash class which does not distinguish between symbols and strings for its keys.

checks:
  ruby:
    setup: >
      composers = HashWithIndifferentAccess.new
      composers[:Janacek] = "Leos Janacek"
      composers["Sweelinck"] = "Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck"

      mathematicians = HashWithIndifferentAccess["Yutaka", "Taniyama", :Alonzo, "Church"]

    asserts:
      - assert_equal composers["Janacek"], "Leos Janacek"
      - assert_equal composers[:Sweelinck], "Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck"
      - assert_equal mathematicians[:Yutaka], "Taniyama"
      - assert_equal (mathematicians["Alonzo"] == mathematicians[:Alonzo]), true
