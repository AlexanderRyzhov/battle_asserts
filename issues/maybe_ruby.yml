      When you want to call a method on an object only if it is not nil,
      the simplest way to achieve it is with conditional statements, adding unnecessary clutter.
      The alternative is to use try. try is like Object#send except that it returns nil if sent to nil.
checks:
  ruby: |-
    assert_equal nil, nil.try(:hello)
    assert_equal 5, 'hello'.try(:length)
    assert 3.try(:is_a?, Numeric)
    assert_equal nil,  nil.try {|obj| obj.pifpaf}
    assert_equal "superclass: Object",  String.try {|obj| "superclass: #{obj.superclass}"}
