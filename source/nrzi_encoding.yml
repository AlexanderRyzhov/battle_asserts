  Non return to zero, inverted (NRZI) is a method of mapping a binary signal to a physical signal
  for transmission over some transmission media. The two level NRZI signal has a transition at
  a clock boundary if the bit being transmitted is a logical 1,
  and does not have a transition if the bit being transmitted is a logical 0.
