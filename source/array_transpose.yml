  Implement the matrix transposition function. Matrices are presented as arrays of arrays, where internal arrays are rows of the matrix.

  Transposition consists of three steps: 1) reflect the array over its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right); 2) write the rows of the original matrix as columns of the new one; 3) write the columns of the original matrix as rows of the new one.
